Hello!

Testing the idea of using jekyll to generate the new remarkable. 

Example using json takes `_data/items.json` as source, while [Example using jekyll collection]({% link collection.md | relative_url %}) uses the `_items` directory. Both were initially generated by the python script `remarkable_list_tool.py`.

Having the awesome list on a website allows us to introduce tags to visually filter items, and much more! Pull requests can just add a new markdown doc on _items. Many stuff
